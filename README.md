# vlandriver
VLAN drvier for docker/libnetwork

We will implement the VLAN driver in libnetwork!

Docker is not popular yet in the enterprise systems. Especially there are many barriers in migration from legacy environments to containers. Why?  Current Docker doesn't have necessary functions for them. For example, VLAN is be widely used in many cases.
However current Docker networking cannot set up about VLAN. In this project, We will make the VLAN extension for the Docker networking to make Docker more popular in the enterprise systems.
